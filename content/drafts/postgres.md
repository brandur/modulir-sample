## Schemas (#schemas)

### BIGINT and BIGSERIAL (#bigint-and-bigserial)

When adding an integer column or one that should contain a sequence, it's
tempting to reach for the defaults of `INT` and `SERIAL`.

Both of these are 32-bit data types. There are a few important things to know
about them:

1. If you run out of runway on a 32-bit `SERIAL`, you'll need to resize it.
   This is not a cheap operation.
2. On a 64-bit machine (which are pretty much ubiquitous these days, a 32-bit
   type isn't actually going to save you any space [1].

Save yourself some pain and always use `BIGINT` and `BIGSERIAL` instead.

### NOT NULL (#not-null)

Apply `NOT NULL` liberally and _early_.

An app's data starts small and uniform, but as it grows, those previously
unthinkable edge cases start to happen more and more often until the data still
follows a general _shape_, but with many exceptions that were never supposed to
be there. This will manifest as a problem during migrations for example, where
a script encounters something unexpected and crashes, forcing you to go in an
examine it manually.

The beauty of a relational database is that it can apply constraints even when
an application talking to hit has a bug. Those constraints can form a final and
impenetrable layer of defense to ensure data that's universally consistent.

Constraints are good, and the more the better. While they might slow your
development down in the early stages of a project, they'll save you thousands
of hours of manual data correction later on. Always default columns that should
be required to `NOT NULL`.

### Text Fields (#text)

In Postgres, `varchar` [has absolutely no performance or storage advantage over
`text`][text]. Over a certain size of data, all values end up [in TOAST][toast]
(The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique).

`varchar` can cost you though, in that it can cause significant churn if you
realize later that you need a different size and have to alter the table.

Always use `text`. If you need to constraint its check (and you _absolutely_
should), use a `CHECK` constraint (see below). A `CHECK` constraint can be
modified instantly at any time.

### JSONB (#json)

Occasionally you might want to have a grab bucket of arbitrary values in a
table and resort to one of the `json`, `jsonb`, or `hstore` types.

`json` is functionally equivalent to `hstore` except better because it supports
the same basic types as found in a normal JSON documents (`hstore` values can
only be strings).

In the same way, `jsonb` is functionally identical to `json` except better:
when operating on a `jsonb` column Postgres doesn't need to reparse its
contents; they're already available in a format that can be loaded directly
into memory. `jsonb` also supports indexing.

There's a simple heuristic: always pick `jsonb`.

### Partial Indexes (#partial-indexes)

Postgres allows an index to be created with a `WHERE` clause. This can save a
lot of storage space in a large table by allowing you to only build indexes
along predicates that we care about.

But where partial indexes really shine is when they're combined with `UNIQUE`.
Imagine this situation:

``` sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_users_on_email WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

This an incredibly easy way to ensure that no two users are created with the
same email. You can even check this at the application level as well to give
most users a nice error message, but rely on Postgres to guarantee that two
requests to create a user with the same email only a millisecond apart can't
both succeed.

### Timestamps (#timestamps)

Use `timestamptz` (otherwise known as `timestamp with time zone`) everywhere
and store everything as UTC.

This might seem obvious, but it's surprisingly easy to make mistakes when it
comes to times. I managed an old database that started storing times in Pacific
and it was such an incredible pain amount of effort to fix (there were hundreds
of time columns in total) that even years later it never happened.

### Check Constraints (#check-constraints)

SQL allows `CHECK` constraints to be defined on a table. These will verify that
an arbitrary boolean condition is true before allowing an insert or update.

For example, we might verify that a price is a positive value:

``` sql
CHECK (price > 0)
```

Or that a `text` field complies to a certain length (similar to what a
`VARCHAR` gets you except that it can be changed instantly):

``` sql
CHECK (char_length(name) <= 255)
```

Constraints are good. Even if you have equivalent application-level validation
logic, use `CHECK` liberally.

## psql (#psql)

While there are a few decent GUIs available that will talk to Postgres, I'd
suggest becoming intimately familiar with Postgres' built-in psql tool. It's an
incredibly efficient way to quickly get visibility into and manage a running
database.

### Editor (#editor)

Do you ever find it awkward editing queries from a prompt? Try this:

```
\e
```

The command will invoke your favorite `$EDITOR` to edit your last command.

### Automatic Expanded Results (#x-auto)

The `\x` option activates an "expanded" display mode. Setting its value to
`auto` activates it only when values are too large to comfortably fit on the
screen:

```
\x auto
```

So if we have a basic table seeded with values:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE companies (name text, location text, description text);
INSERT INTO companies (name, location) VALUES
    ('AirBnB', 'San Francisco'),
    ('Stripe', 'San Francisco'),
    ('Uber', 'San Francisco');
```

As expected, we get a nicely formatted table when selecting on it:

```
=# select * from companies;
  name  |   location    | description
--------+---------------+-------------
 AirBnB | San Francisco |
 Stripe | San Francisco |
 Uber   | San Francisco |
(3 rows)
```

But this formatting starts to break down when very long values are
introduced into the table. `\x auto` ensures that in such a case, we
get expanded view instead:

```
=# UPDATE companies SET description = 'AirBnB is an online marketplace that allows property owners or dwellers to list their lodgings for short term occupancy by other us ers on the service.' WHERE name = 'AirBnB';
UPDATE 1

=# \x auto
Expanded display is used automatically.

=# select * from companies;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
name        | Stripe
location    | San Francisco
description |
-[ RECORD 2 ]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
name        | Uber
location    | San Francisco
description |
-[ RECORD 3 ]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
name        | AirBnB
location    | San Francisco
description | AirBnB is an online marketplace that allows property owners or dwellers to list their lodgings for short term occupancy by other users on the service.
```

### Interactive Error Rollback (#on-error-rollback-interactive)

Imagine a situation where you're in a transaction, finish executing a
long-lived command like an expensive table alteration, go to perform a minor
check, and make a typo while doing it. Postgres will give you one of these:

```
ERROR:â€‚current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
```

Which will leave your transaction in an unusable state, destroying your
hard-won work.

The `ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK` setting set to `interactive` will prevent that by
setting an implicit savepoint before every commanded executed from psql. When a
command fails, we automatically roll back to the last savepoint, and thus save
the parent transaction:

```
\set ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK interactive
```

## Operations (#operations)

So you've already got a big database. Here's some basic operational advice on
how to manage it.

### Raise and Drop Indexes Concurrently (#concurrently)

When adding or removing an index, use the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword to avoid a write lock on the table:

```
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_companies_name
    ON companies (name);

DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_companies_name;
```

The one caveat is that you can't run concurrent operations from inside a
transaction, but especially when it comes to indexes, it's a trade that's well
worthwhile.

### Dangerous Operations (#dangerous-operations)

A major problem with databases is that it's not obvious what DDL operations are
safe or unsafe when it comes to running them on a high-volume installation. The
addition or removal of a few characters might be the different between an
operation that runs instantly and one that takes a table lock and blocks all
inserts and updates.

It's important to be somewhat cognizant of a table's size (even locking
operations are relatively safe to run on small tales because they happen so
quickly) and the side effects of any particular DDL command.

Here are a list of safe versus unsafe operations:

<figure>
  <div class="table-container">
    <table class="overflowing">
    </table>
  </div>
</figure>

### pg_stat_activity (#pg-stat-activity)

See running processes.

### application_name (#application-name)

``` sql
SET application_name TO 'api-worker';
```

## Features (#features)

### Listen/Notify (#listen-notify)

## SQL (#sql)

### Intervals (#intervals)

``` sql
SELECT now() - '1 month'::interval;
```

### With Clauses (#with-clause)

Names subselects

PVH: You can actually share a SQL query with another human being [2].

``` sql
WITH ()
```

### Window Functions (#window-functions)

``` sql
OVER PARTITION BY
```

[1] This is true in the general case, but if a 32-bit type is compounded with
another 32-bit type in an index, there is _some_ potential for space saving.
